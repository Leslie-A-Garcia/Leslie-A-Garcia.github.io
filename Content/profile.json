  "AboutText": "Hi, I'm Leslie Garcia, a mechanical engineering graduate from Seattle Pacific University motivated for growth and want to help bring innovation. I am currently preparing to take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam. I have experience in collaberative projects that require attention to detail, orginization, as well as creativity. I would like to expand my knowledge and skills in various areas of the mechanical engineering industry.<br><br>Beyond engineering, I enjoy playing the violin, baking royal icing sugar cookies, and volunteering at my church. I enjoy using my skills in multiple forms. From the attention to detail with icing cookies and document drafting or the creativity that comes with playing violin and design development of a protoype â€” this strengtens my abilities to adapt and approach problems from a unique perpective to the engineering field."

"Experience": {
  "ExperienceText": "Hi",
  "School": "Seattle Pacific University",
  "Major": "Mechanical Engineering",
  "Graduation": "June 2025",
  "EducationText": "Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering where I worked in interdisipinary teams during my junior and senior year. My senior capstone project involved not only designing and fabrication, but also project managment. Weekly progress reports involved bill of materials, risk midigation and project timeline,. This project was awarded best oral presentation at the 23rd Erickson Conference. I also competed in the 2025 Social Venture Competition presenting with my peers an automatic stepstool they had made and recieved positive feedback by the judges and guests on effectively presenting the social impact and innovation.",
  "Employment": "Wood Harbinger",
  "Role": "Mechanical Intern",
  "EmploymentText": "During my time here, I not only got to do design work and load calculations, but I also got very experiecned in comissioning tasks. Doing these tasks helped me learn more about HVAC systems and how they operate. I created installation checklists and functional tests on multiple projects at a time and became proficent in reading contruction documents. I had the oppertunity to go on site to see a project's process for myself and interact with the people involved such as the aritect and client. I also partisipated in an existing conditions assessment on site as well. This included going into the attic to take note of the vent layout and assess the air handling unit. ",
  "Skills": ["SOLIDWORKS, AutoCAD, Revit, MATLAB, Excel, Trace, LabVIEW"],
  "SkillsText": "I am very experienced in using SOILDWORKS to design and print. I have a small amount of experience in SOLIDWORKS finite element Anaysis (FEA) and animation. I did basic tasks AutoCAD and revit.<br><br>I have 2 years of experience with MATLAB. I created a MATLAB scripted that predicted system behavior in a budget DIY AC. I also used MATLAB for spatial descriptions and translation of a theoretical robot arm.<br><br>I learned the basics of LabVEIW in Experimental methods in exercises such as caculating terminal velocity and graphing the vertical position of a point on a moving bicyclewheel as a function of time.",
